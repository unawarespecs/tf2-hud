# A Personal TF2 Hud

This HUD is a mishmash of elements from various huds such as rayshud, ahud, etc. mixed with the defaults.

Since I made this hud for personal use, I may rewrite/reimplement the edits I made and rebase it on top of the stock hud (or use #base, just like [budhud](https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud))

Checkout the [dev](https://github.com/unawarespecs/tf2-hud/tree/hud_rewrite) branch for the latest changes (and possible updates).
